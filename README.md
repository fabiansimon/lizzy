## Project

The project focuses on creating a blockchain-based license management system to address
challenges faced by both businesses and end-users in the current software licensing land-
scape. End-users often experience a lack of real ownership, risk of losing licenses, and
restrictive company policies, while businesses struggle with piracy, complex license man-
agement, and revenue loss due to fraud. By leveraging Ethereum-based smart contracts,
the solution will enable true ownership and control for end-users, simplify license transfers
and rentals, and ensure clear licensing terms. For businesses, it will streamline license
management, reduce piracy and fraud, and increase revenue through secure, transparent
licensing. The plan involves developing a B2B/B2C platform, along with an API valida-
tor, to create a flexible and reliable licensing solution powered by blockchain technology.
Additionally we will do a feasability analysis to the proposed solution.
